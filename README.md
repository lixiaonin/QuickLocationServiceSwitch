# QuickLocationServiceSwitch
Shortcut to location service settings page, iOS(iPhone), one click.

Most iPhone users wanna save their battery life. Turning off location service seems to help. But when you are on the street in a cold weather trying to navigate or route to somewhere, you really wish to turn location service back on asap. This is where our little shortcut can help. 
你是否有过，在寒风中想要开启iPhone定位功能却不得不在设置里的两级菜单内滑动、点击查找 的经历。希望这个小小快捷方式可以暂时填补这个功能空缺。

This app doesn't do anything but redirect you to Settings > Privacy > Location Services.
很简单，这个app只做一件事，把你重定位到定位的那个子目录，让你可以在主界面出发，两次点击开启定位，三次点击关掉定位（确认多了一下点击。。）。

Put this little shortcut app next to your Google Maps or native Maps app just so you can remember to use it.
把这个快捷方式放在谷（BAI(GAO)）歌(DU(DE))地图旁边, 会让你记得用它。

* Hope apple can realize that turning location service on and off can be as useful as the wifi switch and put it in the bottom control center in the next iOS update.
* 希望苹果爸爸倾听用户的呼声，把这个小功能放在底边的控制栏里面。
